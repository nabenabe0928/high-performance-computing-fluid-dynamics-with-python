\chapter{Conclusions}
In this paper, we describe what LBM is
and how we implement it.
Chapter 1 describes the motivation behind the numerical integrations
and mentions that the advantages of LBM, i.e.
simple implementation and the scalability with respect to the computational
resources.

Chapter 2 explains the theoretical aspects of LBM
and how those equations are pluged in the simulation.
Additionally, we show the algorithms of each component.
Each algorithm in our implementation
is tested using pytest and abstracted as much as possible
so that each component can be reused and we can reduce
the bugs over the whole implementations.

Chapter 3 presents the validations of each component
using the comparison between the analytical solutions
and visualizes how LBM works in the lid-driven cavity
example.
For the validations, we use the shear wave decay, 
the Couette flow and the Poissuille flow
and show the analytical solutions for each phenomenon.
After the validations, we show the lid-driven cavity simulation
exhibits the similar dynamics when we have a constant Reynolds number.
Furthermore, we test the scalability of 
LBM in the lid-driven cavity simulation
and show about the 30 times speed up using 100 processes.
